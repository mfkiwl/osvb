.. _OSVB:API:Project:

Project
#######

This section covers the definition of an API for binding the sources and options from the :ref:`OSVB:API:Core` to the
interfaces in :ref:`OSVB:API:Tool`, :ref:`OSVB:API:Runner` and :ref:`OSVB:API:Logging`. The Project management API is
responsible for deciding which tasks to execute and the order for doing it, as well as gathering and interpreting the
results.
